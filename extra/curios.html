            Curios are items with special properties, appearing as anything from weapons, to armors, to trinkets, to implants.<br>
            It's scope isn't limited to just "magic", Curios can be technological marvels, like a laser sword for Tiered Armament.<br>
            An item could have multiple Curio Effects, when that's the case, all Curio Effects are looked at separately!
        </p>
        <p>
            To be able to use a Curio, you must have them somewhere on your person, and be currently <b>Attuned</b> to them.<br>
            Attunement is an <a href="../main/mechanics.html#interact" target="_blank">Interact Action</a> <b>(Bonus-Action)</b><br>
            Each time Attuning you can Un-Attune and Attune to any number of Curios at once.
