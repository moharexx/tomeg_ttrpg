            Potions are (often) a Single-Use container of a Spell.<br>
            Players may get to possess Potions from many sources, from Finding, to Purchasing, or even Creating them.

            A Potion has an Ability Stored in them. Depending on the Type of Potion the Ability might come out in different ways on usage.<br>
            A Potions rarity is mainly dependant on the ESS of the Ability stored inside.
