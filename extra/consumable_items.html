        <p>
            Consumable Items are made to be used in the pinch of combat, and as the name suggest, are single use.<br>
            They do <b>NOT</b> require Wielding Slots to be used!<br>
            This means you don't need to <a href="../main/mechanics.html#switch_weapon" target="_blank">Switch Weapon</a> to use, only have it at hand, on a belt, ect...

        <hr>
        <p>
            Scrolls are Items which store a single Cast of an Ability with the Item's own ESS.<br>
            Scrolls can appear in many forms for enhanced flavor, from regular scrolls, to imbued gems, to tatoos, to runes, to whatever trinkets.<br>
            Scrolls can store any kind of Ability, even modified with Meta-Abilities, but any Ability Cast from a Scroll will be count as Spell Type.<br>
            Even On-Attacks, Reactions, and Stances can be stored in Scrolls.
        </p>
        <p>
            Abilities Cast through a Scroll can be modified further at the moment of Cast by your own Magic Items and Meta-Abilities.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Scroll's Cast Time is the same as the Ability's, modified normally by any Meta-Ability.<br>
            Scrolls can have up to <box>2 × ESS</box> extra Potency, increasing Market Price by <b>10C</b> per Point.<br>
            For Resource Costs, the Scroll has it built in, and the User doesn't have to Spend any Resources.

            The other way is to make a Melee or Ranged Attack with it, like if it was a <b>Finesse Throwable Light Melee Weapon.</b><br>
            For directional AOE, when consumed the User tells the Orientation, when used as an Attack it goes in the direction of the Attack.
