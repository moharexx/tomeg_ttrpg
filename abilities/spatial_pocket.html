(or not if the Caster decides...)<br>1 meter in the Spatial Pocket is also 1 meter outside the Spatial Pocket!<br>Gravity inside the Spatial Pocket is either fixed, or constantly updates based on the outside, Caster's choice.<br>If the Passageway(s) of the Spatial Pocket are moved/rotated then the Spatial Pocket also moves/rotates with it.<br>Even tho the Spatial Pocket is moved/rotated there is NO inner inertia, so it doesn't fling everything inside.<br>A Passageway CAN enter another Passageway. Go ham.<br></p><p>If the Duration runs out, every Passageway connecting to the space Breaks and everything is gently pushed back out.<br>If there isn't enought space in the outside then what happens is up to the GM.<br>The Caster can <b>Critically Fail</b> the Ability as a Bonus-Action.<br></p><p class="bottomless"><b>Creating a Passageway midair or on a surface:</b></p><ul><li>The Passageway just appears, and can be an up to <box>ESS^(1/3) meters side length cube</box></li><li>Yes, the Passageway can be a 3 dimensional "object".</li><li>The Caster designates which sides of the Passageway are enterable, passable, transparent, and/or solid.</li><li>A solid side of the Passageway is just the <b>Spatial Pocket's Wall.</b></li><li>The inside of the space's outer surface if also the <b>Spatial Pocket's Wall.</b></li></ul><p class="bottomless"><b>Using an already existing Passageway:</b></p><ul><li>Using an already existing physical Passageway, like a door, can be linked to the newly created space.</li><li>When doing so the Caster can decide if the original space behind the Passageway remains reachable or is closed off.</li><li>If it's closed off then the <b>Spatial Pocket's Wall</b> is the thing which blocks the original path.</li></ul><p class="bottomless"><b>Increasing the size of an already existing space:</b></p><ul><li>You can only do this while already inside of a space or by Touching the edges (like a wall) of the space.</li><li>This can increase the size of the inner space by moving said edges further, this does NOT move anything inside the space.</li><li>But it does move the edges of the space, and everything on them (like a window or a door) further.</li><li>The way said edges extend is up to the Caster, and can be geometrically complex, changing the overall shape of the room(s).</li><li>Any extension made cannot be farther away from the Caster than <box>10 × ESS^(1/3)</box> meters.</li></ul><p class="bottomless"><b>Spatial Pocket Critical Failure:</b></p><ul><li>All Passageways connecting to the space Break, and the space quickly shrinks back to normal.</li><li>If there isn't enough space to stay inside then all inside recieve <box>(10 × ESS) Bludgeon Damage</box>, then be forcefully expelled.</li><li>Even if there isn't an big enough hole to expell everything it will still be expelled because the Pocket's Wall will tear.</li><li>Exact details, like landing position is up to GM.</li></ul><p class="bottomless"><b>Examples:</b></p><ul><li>You Touch a cup, it becomes very deep and wide inside, and can hold a lot of liquid.</li><li>You Touch a door, the room behind it is now bigger, or it opens to a new room entirely.</li><li>You Touch a the air, a floating hole opens to an inside space.</li><li>You "Touch" the space inside a room, it gets bigger.</li></ul><p class="bottomless"><b>Multi Passageway System</b> (50 Transmutation):</p><ul><li>A Spatial Pocket can have multiple Passageways.</li><li>To do this you must Recast the Ability to create a new Passageway, either from in to out or from out to in.</li><li>Keep in mind that 1 meter inside is also 1 meter outside!</li><li>If a Spatial Pocket has multiple Passageways, and one is moved relative to the others, then that Passageway Breaks.</li><li>If all the Passageways connecting to a Spatial Pocket are moved so that they remain in the same position and orientation then nothing Breaks.</li><li>You can attempt to Cast this on a Spatial Pocket not yours, if this Ability's ESS is more than their Spatial Pocket's.</li></ul><p class="bottomless"><b><a href="../abilities/ritual.html" target="_blank">Ritual</a> Override Interaction:</b></p><ul><li>The way Ritual is interacting with <b>Inner Space</b> is Overriden.</li><li>Rather than benefiting from Rital's ESS Multiplier, it is simply Multiplied by the Rounds it took to Cast.</li></ul><h2>Stats</h2><hr><table width="100%"><tr><td width=30%">Ability Stat</td><td width=70%">Value</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Cast Time</td><td width=70%">Main-Action + Bonus-Action</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Duration</td><td width=70%">1 Minute (20 Rounds)</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Range</td><td width=70%">Touch</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">(VIT | Soul) Save</td><td width=70%">ESS</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Inner Space</td><td width=70%">ESS m<sup>3</sup></td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Max 2 Point Distance</td><td width=70%">10 × ESS^(1/3)</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Wall HP</td><td width=70%">10 × ESS</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Wall Armor VS All</td><td width=70%">6 × ESS</td></tr></table></main>
