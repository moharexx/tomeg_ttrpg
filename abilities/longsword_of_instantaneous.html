                <li>weapon mastery + martial arts (cuz basics?)</li>
                <li>inertia control (into surrounding conjured material (in my case fire))</li>
                <li>spatial manipulation (duh)</li>
                <li>local physics manipulation (to increase the max speed / speed of light on yourself, reduce your mass)</li>
                <li>change/time manipulation (for extra "charge" potential, slow down time, and at cast time instantly speed it up)</li>
                </ul><p>It might be the fastest ability, but due to moharexx's lacking speed it is not the fastest in moharexx's hand, if there would be a hyperentity of speed, or someone more skilled who mastered the move they would easily be faster.<br></p><h2>Stats</h2><hr><table width="100%"><tr><td width=30%">Ability Stat</td><td width=70%">Value</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Cast Time</td><td width=70%">Main-Action + Bonus-Action</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Stance Trigger</td><td width=70%">Free-Action at Your Next Turn</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">To-Hit Multiplier</td><td width=70%">2×</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Line Length</td><td width=70%">MS</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Damage</td><td width=70%">(2d4 × ESS) Weapon Damage</td></tr><tr><td width=30%">Penetration</td><td width=70%">9 × ESS</td></tr></table></main>
