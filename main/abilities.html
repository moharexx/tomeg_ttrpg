        <hr>
        <p>
            Abilities are special things Entities can do, which require to be Unlocked.<br>
            Abilities canonically have an Essence Cost, we don't keep track of it as a Resource, assume you always have enough Essence.<br>
            When listing the Stats (like Damage) of Abilities you will see ESS, this is the Essence Cost, which scales with your Total XP.<br>
            <b>Maximum ESS Of Abilities:</b> <box>Total XP / 100</box>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Casting Stat</b> will be used to calculate the Stats of a lot of Spell Type Abilities, shortened to <b>CS.</b><br>
            CS is equal to: <box>INT | WILL | EGO</box><br>
        </p>
        <p class="bottomless"><b>Basic Assumptions:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spell Ability To-Hit Modifier: <box>CS / 2</box></li>
            <li>Skill Ability To-Hit Modifier: <box>Same as Attack with the used Weapon (Includes Natural Weapons)</box></li>
            <li>Touch Abilities have the same Reach as your Natural Melee Weapons.</li>
            <li>Touch Abilities have the same To-Hit as a <b>Natural Melee Weapon</b>, but can be the same a Spell's when it's a Spell.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Unlocking an Ability canonically makes you able to do more than the simple combat description of the Ability.<br>
            Like with a fire ability you also gain some control over fire itself, moving, reshaping, coloring, bending, ect...<br>
            These uses are called "tricks", these are less combat realated uses.<br>
            <b>Example:</b> With Fire Bolt you can conjure a small flame above your palm.
        </p>
        <h2 id="ability_categories">Ability Categories</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="bottomless"><b>Active Abilities:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>These Abilities are your usual ones, often coming out instantly when used.</li>
            <li>You can count Free-Action Active Abilities with a Duration as basically a Passive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bottomless"><b>On-Attack Abilities:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>These Abilities can only be used on an Attack or Save, to enhance it in some way.</li>
            <li>On-Attack Abilities must be commited to before the Attack.</li>
            <li>By default if the Attack or Save is an AOE, the On-Attack will Target ONLY ONE chosen Hit Target!</li>
            <li>When an On-Attack and the Parent Attack both do the same Damage Type, count it as a singular Damage Instance.</li>
            <li>If there are <b>Offspring Attacks,</b> they do carry on all On-Attack Abilities.</li>
            <li>The Offspring Attack does NOT carry on the On-Attack which caused itself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bottomless"><b>Reactive Abilities:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>These Abilities can only be used when an Activation Condition is met.</li>
            <li>These can be used outside of the caster's Turn.</li>
            <li>When more Entities want to use Reactions at the same time, they do in Descending INIT Order.</li>
            <li>Reacting before an Attack, with a Reaction without Specific Trigger can only be if your <box>4 × INIT</box> is higher than <b>Attack's To-Hit.</b></li>
            <li>Unaware Targets cannot make <b>Reactions</b>, unless their <box>2 × INIT</box> is at least <b>Attack's To-Hit</b> or <box>2 × Save's Difficulty</box></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bottomless"><b>Stance Abilities:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>These Abilities, when used put you in a Stance, there are things which can Break or Trigger a Stance.</li>
            <li><b>Attack-Action, Defense-Action, Shoving, and Grappling</b> Count as Abilities when Breaking Stances!</li>
            <li>Triggering a Stance also Breaks it.</li>
            <li>You can only be in one Stance at a time.</li>
            <li>You can Break your own Stance as a Free-Action.</li>
            <li>Using On-Attack Abilities do not Break the Stance.</li>
            <li>Stacking Stances are stackable by casting the Stance multiple times before Triggering.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bottomless"><b>Meta Abilities:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>These Abilities are used when using a different Ability.</li>
            <li>These Modify the Ability in some ways.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bottomless"><b>Passive Abilities:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>These Abilities are always active, unless the requirements are lost.</li>
            <li>Passives tagged with <b>Auto</b> will apply automatically if the Requirements are met.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="Proxy">Proxy</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Entites have a Special Stat called Proxy, this is Equal to their <box>Max SP</box><br>
            For some Abilities Proxy determines the Maximum Amount of Entites the Caster can Control.<br>
            If the Caster reaches <box>0 SP</box> it loses all Control.
        </p>
        <h1 id="spell_memorization">Spell Memorization</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            For <box>5 XP</box> Memorization of <b>Spell Type Abilities</b> can be Unlocked.<br>
            You gain Memory Slots equal to <box>INT + Arcana</box>, and each Spell takes up Slots equal to <box>it's Unlock XP Cost.</box><br>
            When a Spell is Memorized it can be regularly Cast, but cannot be modified with Meta-Abilities, and <b>CS</b> will always be <b>INT.</b><br>
            If an Ability has <b>Unlocks</b>, those can be Memorized for Extra Memory Slots equal to the <box>Unlock's XP Cost.</box><br>
            Meta-Abilities Abilities cannot be Memorized, but Passive Abilities can.
        </p>
        <p>
            Memorization takes <box>4 / (INT + Arcana)</box> Hours for each Memory Slot being overwritten.<br>
            Memorization is done with studying a written down Spell for said time.<br>
            If the Memorization process is interrupted it can be resumed later.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for finding Written down Spells it is mostly up to the GM, but there are a few suggestions here.<br>
            Written Spells can be found in many forms, from books to scrolls, to even identified magical things such as wands, staffs, rods, magic circles, ect...<br>
            When found in Scrolls or other magical items, to Memorize them, there is an Arcana Check with a high Difficulty, due to the need to decompile it's content.
        </p>
        <p>
            A written Spell's Market Price is <box>Unlock XP Cost × 10</box>, and may not be on sale, especially higher level Spells.<br>
            When a Spell has <b>Unlocks</b>, those have their own Market Price, it's Cost scaling with Unlock XP the same as Spells.<br>
            If a Spell by default comes with Free Unlock(s), the Written down form will also contain them without additional Costs, or Memory Slots required.<br>
            A Player Character may also write down or copy a Spell they have, this takes <box>100 × Unlock XP Cost / (INT + Arcana)</box> Hours.
        </p>
        <h1 id="ability_wishing">Ability Wishing</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            At <b>500 Total XP</b> you can Unlock the Ability Wishing Feature for <box>20 XP</box><br>
            If the Ability's Unlock XP Cost is equal or less than your EGO, you can Wish that Ability.<br>
            A Wished Ability's <b>CS</b> will be equal to <b>EGO,</b> and treated as an <b>Innate Type Ability</b> even if it's originally a Skill or Spell.<br>
            Wishing an Ability has the same Cast Time as using the Ability, and Meta-Abilities effect the Casting Time as normal.<br>
            Wishing can use any Meta-Abilities, even ones not known by the Caster.<br>
            The GM may allow Wishes that are not normally replicable by an Ability.
        </p>
        <p class="bottomless"><b>Ability Wishing:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have a Pool of Wishes, each Wish takes 1 from this Pool.</li>
            <li>The Pool's Size is <box>log(Total XP)</box> and Replenishes after a Long-Rest.</li>
            <li>If you have more than 10000 Total XP, you can make Wishes at Half ESS without Spending from the Pool.</li>
            <li>You can Spend <b>1 Fate</b> to make a Wish, and not Spend from the Pool.</li>
