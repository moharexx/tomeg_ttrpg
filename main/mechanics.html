        <h1 id="d10_checks">d10 CHECKS</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            d10 Checks are the heart of the game, they are used to determine if things succeed or fail.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You throw a d10, add the Modifier, and add any Bonuses.<br>
            For the Finalized Value, the d10 Check's Natural Value is Multiplied, so it remains relevant at higher levels.<br>
            d10 Multiplier: <box>Modifier / 5</box> (Minimum of 1)<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Example:</b> Throwing a Natural 4, with a Modifier of +12, will result in a Finalized Value of
            20 (4 × 2 + 12)
        </p>
        <p>
            <box><span style="color: green;">(<span style="color: red;">(d10 Base Value × <span style="color: blue;">Max(1, Modifier / 5)</span>)</span> + Modifier + Bonus)</span> × (Advantage|Disadvantage) + Finalized Bonus</box>
        </p>
        <h2 id="criticals">Criticals</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            There is a Stat called CRIT Range, by default this is equal to 1.<br>
            When Rolling a d10 Check, if the Natural Value is atleast <box>11 - CRIT Range</box> then the Check is a CRIT.<br>
            <b>A CRIT Results in:</b> 2× Damage, 2× Healing, 2× Shielding, 2× BUFFER<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You may roll a d10 to determine CRIT for things which by default don't require a d10 Check, like Healing Spells.<br>
            Some features might add or subtract from the CRIT Range, potentionally making it impossible to CRIT.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Example:</b> Throwing a Natural 10 with the base CRIT Range of 1 will result in a CRIT.<br>
            <b>Example:</b> Throwing a Natural 7 with 4 CRIT Range is a CRIT.<br>
            <b>Example:</b> With 0 or less CRIT Range, even a Natural 10 won't be a CRIT.
        </p>
        <h2 id="advantage_and_disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <b>Advantage:</b> Double the Value of the d10 Check, including Bonuses.<br>
            <b>Disadvantage:</b> Half the Value of the d10 Check, including Bonuses.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Advantage and Disadvantage do not stack, and cancel each other out.<br>
            This means even 1 Advantage cancels out 3 Disadvantages, to where there is no Multiplier.
        </p>
        <h2 id="stable_checks">Stable Checks</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            For Stable Checks, the d10 Natural Value Multiplication is Overridden to <box>Total XP / 100</box> (Minimum of 1)<br>
            Advantage and Disadvantage Double and Half only the Dice's Value, leaving Modifier and Bonuses unchanged.<br>
            <a href="#saves">Saves</a> and <a href="#initiative">Initiatives</a> are <b>Stable Checks.</b>
        </p>
        <h2 id="multi_checks">Multi-Checks</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Multi-Checks are Single Checks with multiple different Modifiers.<br>
            You Roll only one d10, and seperately calculate the values with the different Modifiers.<br>
            Note that Success with one of the Modifiers usually has the same effect as with the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Example:</b> You make a Check which uses both Perception and Intuition, with Modifiers of +5 and +10.<br>
            You Rolled a 6 on the d10, this means the Perception part of the Multi-Check is 11, and the Intuition part is 22.
        </p>
        <h2 id="passive_checks">Passive Checks</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Passive Checks are a Type of Check where the d10 is not thrown, and only the Modifier and Bonuses are counted.<br>
            These Checks are always a Free-Action, and are assumed to be automatically made, unless someone specifies they don't make said Passive Check.
        </p>
        <h1 id="base_stats">BASE STATS</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            There are 6 Base Stats Entities can have.<br>
            Maximum of any Base Stat of an Entity: <box>Total XP / 10</box><br>
            Base Stat d10 Check Modifier: <box>Stat / 2</box>

                <b>Sensing</b> is when you know something is there, but not necessarily <b>Pinpointing</b> it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Pinpointing</b> is when a Sense can accurately define the position of a Target.<br>
                By default, a regular human (or alike) can only Pinpoint with Sight.<br>
                If another Sense can Pinpoint, then it is usually written out, and made obvious.<br>
                An Entity which cannot Pinpoint another has Disadvantage againts them, and the hidden one has Advantage against said Entity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Example:</b> You hear a person speak, but not see them. You Sense them, but not Pinpoint them.<br>
                <b>Example:</b> A Blinded Bandit has Disadvantage toward all other Entities, and all others (who can
                Pinpoint said Bandit) have Advantage againts the Bandit.<br>

        </p>
        <h1 id="resistances">RESISTANCES</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Resistance means taking less Damage equal to the Resistance Value, each Damage instance, written as [Type]-RES.<br>
            Resistance can reduce the Damage Taken to 0, but not below 0.<br>
            <b>Example:</b> Heat-RES, Bio-RES, ect...<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Armor</b> is Resistance VS Bludgeoning, Slashing, and Piercing.<br>
            <b>Armor VS All</b> is Resistance towards all Damage Types, but True Damage.<br>
            <b>Armor VS HP</b> is Resistance towards all Damage which goes into HP, but True Damage.<br>
            <b>Armor VS SP</b> is Resistance towards all Damage which goes into SP, but True SP Damage.<br>
            Armor VS HP and Armor VS SP do reduce their respective parts from Radiant and Necrotic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weaknesses are treated as Negative Resistance, shortened as [Type]-WEAK.<br>
            When taking Damage, for each point of Damage add +1 Extra Damage up to Max the Weakness's value.<br>
            Resistance and Weaknesses cancel out at a rate of 1 to 1.<br>
            <b>Damage Formula for Weakness:</b> <box>Min(Damage + Weakness, 2 × Damage)</box>
        </p>
        <p>
            Absorption is when the Target gets Healed from the "Damage", shortened as [Damage Type]-ABS.<br>
            When taking Damage, for each point of Damage, turn it into Healing, up to a Max of the Absorption's value.<br>
            This means, even with Absorption, the Target might take actual Damage at high enough Damage values.<br>
            Absorption applies before Resistance and Weakness, in case it isn't enought to Absorb all the Damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Penetration is Resistance Negation, written as [Type]-Pen.<br>
            Penetration can't reduce Resistance to negative values.<br>
            If a Meta-Ability, or similar, changes the Damage Type of something, the Penetration Type is also changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Things with loose physical presence (air, shadow and light Entities, ect...) have 100 Armor.<br>
            Incorporeal things have 1000 Armor.

        <h2 id="rest_hp">REST-HP</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            REST-HP is spent in Short-Rests to recover HP.<br>
            REST-HP is restored after a Long-Rest.<br>
            If an Ability Costs REST-HP, it can also be paid in HP.
        </p>
        <h2 id="buffer">BUFFER</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            BUFFER, as the name implies, is a buffer for recieving Damage.<br>
            When taking any kind of Damage, the <b>Post-Mitigation</b> will go into the BUFFER rather than HP or SP.<br>
            Any excess Damage not stopped by the BUFFER goes past it, into the HP or SP.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Hybrid Damage the BUFFER recieves both HP and SP, effectively Doubling Damage recieved by the BUFFER.<br>
            The Target chooses the order of Damage which goes into their BUFFER, if the Damage is Hybrid or Multiple Type.<br>
            <b>Example:</b> Recieving Radiant (Hybrid), the Target chooses that first the SP part goes into the BUFFER.
        </p>
        <p>
            A BUFFER cannot be Healed, normally.<br>
            BUFFERs cannot Stack, the Target chooses between sources of BUFFER.<br>
            If Duration isn't written, a BUFFER lasts till End of Next Long-Rest.
        </p>
        <h2 id="max_value">Max Value</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            If an amount that should be thrown with Dice has Max on it, it will automatically become the largest value it could achieve.<br>
            Some things might me <b>Minimized</b>, this is the opposite, treat as if you rolled the lowest.<br>
            Maximalizing and Minimizing To-Hit does NOT change it's CRIT state, only the To-Hit!
        </p>
        <h2 id="executing">Executing</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Executing Damage is Damage that will become Max Damage, only if <box>Target HP ≤ Damage</box><br>
            If Damage is a Type which goes into SP then it Max Damage, only if <box>Target SP ≤ Damage</box><br>
            If the Damage goes into both HP and SP then if one of the conditions are met the other part is also Maximalized.
        </p>
        <h2 id="potency">Potency</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            For each point of Potency, an Ability will increase in a Single one of it's Linearly Scaling Ability Stats.<br>
            Potency will fade away on any still ongoing Ability after a Minute! (20 Rounds)<br>
            <b>Examples:</b> Damage, Healing, Shielding, SP, HD, BUFFER, REST-HP, ect...<br>
            <b>Exceptions:</b> Range, Size, Item Tier
        </p>
        <p>
            Spending Potency on Saves will require 2 Potency for each +1 Save Difficulty!
        </p>
        <h2 id="aoe">AOE</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            AOEs are Attacks which effect an area.<br>
            Everything within the Area is counted as Target.<br>
            <b>Examples:</b> Sphere, <b>*Cone</b>, Line, Cylinder, Cube, ect...<br>
            <b>*Cone</b> is not a real cone, it's a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_sector">Sphere Sector</a>, with it's <b>Spread, or Width</b> being the side to side Angle of it.<br>
            <b>Note:</b> Lines, Cylinders, and Disks are technically the same shape.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 3 Types of AOEs; Static, Flowing, and Crawling.<br>
            Static AOEs just Appear, and Ignore any type of Cover.<br>
            Flowing AOEs have a flow.<br>
            A Flowing Sphere AOE will usually have a single point which it expands from, for Example: Fireball.<br>
            A Flowing Line or Cylinder AOE will usually have a single point or plane which it flows from, for Example: Steel Tempest.<br>
            Crawling AOEs abide by all the Rules of Flowing AOEs, but it can Change Flow Direction to fill it's designated AOE.
        </p>
        <p>
            An AOE's center can be the Center of a Hexa or Square, or optionally even the Corner.<br>
            It's up to GM's choice.<br>
            <b>Note:</b> AOEs which start from an Entity, always Start from their middle.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a Flowing AOE Attack is Fully Negated by an Entity, or Tanked by something considered Full Cover, the Flow of the AOE Stops there.<br>
            <b>Example:</b> A Line or Cylinder Hits a Target, which fully Negates the Attack, Entities behind the Target, in a Line are unaffected.<br>
            <b>Example:</b> A Cone or Sphere Hits a Target, which fully Negates the Attack, Entities behind the Target, in a (*small) Cone are unaffected.<br>
            <b>Note:</b> A Crawling AOE will just Crawl around a Target, even if Fully Negated, or even around a Wall if it has enough Range.
