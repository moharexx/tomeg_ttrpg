            A tabletop RPG system created for unhinged individuals by schizophrenic individuals.<br>
            Truly a masterpiece!<br>
            But before you dive into the content, you will need a few basics to understand some of the content you will
            find.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lets start with the basic explanation of Dice!<br>
            Dice are called d#, where # is the amount of sides the dice have.<br>
            For example d6 is a 6 sided dice, 8d6 is the sum of 8, 6 sided dies' values.<br>
            But if you see d6 × 8 that is the result of only one d6 multiplied by 8, totally different!
        </p>
        <p>
            Now for a few Mathmatical notations, yipee!<br>
            If you know programming or math basics then you probably already have most of this knowledge.

        <p>
            Essence, the basis of the Tömegpokalipszis, all there is consists of it, and everything is in relation to it.<br>
            Essence is the amount of charge of a Meta-Concept, which are like abstract <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms">Platonic Forms</a> of building concepts.<br>
            Usually appearing in the form of particles, we call these Essence Particles, or just Essence.<br>
            Each Particle holds some amount of Essence, so charge(s) of a Meta-Concept, even multiple different types at different intensities at once.<br>
            While raw Essence and Essence Particles are different, distinction is often unnecessary as only the amount of charge matters.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are infinite unique different Meta-Concepts, but scholars seperated them into <a href="../main/mechanics.html#magic_masteries">7 different main groups.</a><br>
        </p>
        <h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Magic is what makes the Tömegpokalipszis, reality manipualtion fueled by <b>Essence.</b><br>
            To use up Essence, one must instruct commands to the universe, and pay up with the charge.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            First, one must make instructions of what is to happen.<br>
            The way of making these instructions up determines a style of casting.<br>
            Scholars split these styles into 3 main groups. Wizardry, Psionics, and Sorcery.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wizardry (INT Casting) is all about precise definitions, like coding, often creating the spell well before using it.<br>
            Psionics (WILL Casting) is like a skill, it comes from focus and feedback.<br>
            Sorcery (EGO Casting) is about your character, your desires, and self expression.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then you pay up with the Essence, either ripping it from around you, or using your stored reserves.<br>
            The Essence Circutry in your Soul and Body make the Magic happen as the Essence's charge is used up.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are "magics" often not called Magic, like the natural Essence enhance of strong warriors, and such.<br>
            These also use Essence in the same way, often being Psyonics (WILL Casting), but sometimes else.<br>
            Some use a hybrid way of casting, where their Magic is a mishmash of different casting styles.
